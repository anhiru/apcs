# LeapYear
Design a program that determines whether or not the user inputs a leap year.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 (1980), except that it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 (1900).
However, it is a leap year if it is divisible by 400 (2000). 
There were no exceptions before the introduction of the Gregorian calender on October 15, 1582 (for example, 1500 was a leap year).
