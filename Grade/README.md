# Grade

Taken from [CollegeBoard](https://pages.collegeboard.org/how-to-convert-gpa-4.0-scale):
> Colleges report GPA (grade point average) on a 4.0 scale. The top grade is an A, which equals 4.0. This is the standard scale at most colleges, and many high schools use it.

Design a program that calculates the letter grade equivalent of an inputted GPA value.
