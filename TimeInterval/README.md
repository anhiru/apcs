# TimeInterval

Design a program, TimeInterval.java, that determines the difference between two inputted time signatures. 
The 24-hour clock is the convention of time keeping in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours.
The time is indicated by the hours passed since midnight.
